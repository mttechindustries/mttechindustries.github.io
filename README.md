## 1. Overview

This repository contains the source code and assets for the official website of MT Tech Industries LLC, accessible via `mttechindustries.com` and `mttechindustries.org`.

The primary purpose of this website is to serve as a professional, investor-facing digital presence during our "stealth mode" phase. It is intentionally designed for strategic minimalism.

## 2. Core Philosophy & Purpose

The design of this website is a deliberate strategic choice. Its mission is to:

*   **Establish Professional Legitimacy:** Provide a polished and credible digital footprint for investors, potential partners, and advisors who receive our outreach.
*   **Create Strategic Mystique:** Hint at deep, proprietary technology and a focused mission without revealing any confidential or pre-patent information. The goal is to encourage high-value inquiries, not to educate the general public.
*   **Be Inherently Safe:** By containing zero proprietary technical details, this site protects our intellectual property completely while we operate under "Patent Pending" status.

## 3. Repository Structure

This is a simple, static website. All necessary code is contained within these primary files:

*   **`index.html`**: The main HTML file containing all content and embedded styling for the landing page.
*   **`your-mt-logo.png`**: (Placeholder) The image file for the MT Tech Industries logo displayed on the page. You will need to upload your logo file to this repository and update the name in `index.html`.
*   **`.nojekyll`**: An empty file that tells GitHub Pages to treat this as a static site and not to run it through the Jekyll build process. **Do not delete this file.**
*   **`favicon.ico`**: The small icon that appears in the browser tab.
*   **`README.md`**: This documentation file.

## 4. How to Update the Website

Updates are simple and instant.

1.  Open the `index.html` file directly in GitHub.
2.  Click the "Edit" pencil icon.
3.  Make any necessary changes to the text or content within the HTML.
4.  Scroll to the bottom and click "Commit changes".
5.  The changes will be live within a minute or two.

## 5. Domain Configuration

The content in this repository is hosted by GitHub Pages at `https://mttechindustries.github.io/`.

To ensure `mttechindustries.com` and `mttechindustries.org` point to this site, you must configure two things:

1.  **GitHub Settings:** In this repository's `Settings > Pages > Custom domain` section, enter `www.mttechindustries.com`.
2.  **Namecheap DNS:** In your Namecheap account, configure the DNS settings for `mttechindustries.com` to point to GitHub's servers. You will need to add `A` records and a `CNAME` record.
