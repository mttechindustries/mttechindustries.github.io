# MT Tech Industries LLC

MT Tech Industries LLC is a private research and development firm focused on translating fundamental breakthroughs in applied physics into transformative commercial technologies.

## Company Overview

MT Tech Industries operates at the intersection of applied physics, signal processing, and artificial intelligence to develop next-generation solutions for complex real-world challenges. Our work spans multiple domains including:

- **Applied Physics Research**: Precision wave generation, acoustic levitation, plasma physics, and field manipulation
- **Signal Processing**: Advanced analysis of Channel State Information (CSI), frequency domain processing, and real-time inference
- **AI Integration**: Edge AI deployment, pattern recognition, and autonomous systems
- **Digital Twin Platforms**: Physics-first simulation with hardware constraint enforcement

## Core Technology Areas

### Applied Physics & Acoustics
Our foundational work in precision wave generation and advanced signal processing unlocks new possibilities in communication, safety, and biometric analysis. We specialize in creating controllable physical phenomena that can be reliably reproduced and scaled.

### Digital Twin Simulation
We develop physics-first digital twin platforms that simulate complex systems before physical prototypes are built. This approach reduces development risk and accelerates time-to-market for our advanced technologies.

### Edge AI & Real-Time Systems
Our AI solutions are designed for deployment on embedded systems with real-time constraints, enabling autonomous operation in field environments.
